# html-seo-baker
a html SEO baker, that makes a http request to a running webserver and render the html pages with javascript, it then saves a index.html file based on the visited index.html file (with javascript running fetch calls). The aim for this is to bake the index.html every 30 - 60 min to gain SEO advantages without having to rely on server-side rendering



THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
